   Chief Complaint:  Increased somnolence
   HPI:
   This is an 80 year of female NH resident with a pmhx of aspirations,
   dementia with agitation, HTN, DM2 and frequent UTIs who presents with
   acute onset altered mental status, hypotension and bradycardia. She was
   noted to be non-verbal and non-responsive to visual stimuli this
   morning by her nursing home. At baseline she is verbal but
   intermittently confused. She does not walk on her own. Her BP was noted
   to be 90/60 and HR was found to be 35. FS was 114, afebrile, and
   satting 98% on RA. Of note, per NH report, she was diagnosed with a UTI
   on [**1-8**] and started on levofloxacin. Labs on that day also noted an
   increased BUN to 52 and was started on IVF at her NH. She was then
   transferred to [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 632**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **].
   .
   At [**Hospital1 632**], HR initially remained in the 30s to 40s but BPs were
   initially stable at 102/59. However, she then dropped to the 70s.
   Received 1mg atropine with little effect. Received only 500cc of NS out
   of concern for ? pulmonary edema on CXR. BNP 391. Also noted ? left
   facial droop but initial non-con CT head was negative for acute
   process. Initial CEZ were negative. Due to persistent hypotension she
   was started on peripheral dopamine prior to transfer.
   .
   In the ICU she was diagnosed with a providencia stuartii and
   enterococcus UTI, treated initially with vanc/cefepime, converted to
   ceftriaxone/ampicillin, then back to vanc/cefepime just prior to
   discharge to treat ? VAP seen on CXR. She was intially intubated for
   airway protection and was subsequently extubated on [**1-16**]. She had an
   episode of acute thrombocytopenia and HCT drop of unclear origin. HIT
   Ab initially positive, serotonin release assay pending. Intially on
   argatroban but per Heme, low likelihood of HIT, so turned off.
   .
   On the floor, she had improving WBC with vanc/cefepime, O2 was weened
   to room air. Conversant but never oriented beyond self. Noted RUE
   swelling and found R IJ clot on u/s (previous IJ CVL). Started on
   Fondaparinox and coumadin (3mg) on [**1-19**] with coumadin increased to 5mg
   [**1-20**]. This morning she was noted to be perky and alert, conversant but
   not oriented (baseline). Then this afternoon, when the attending
   rounded, she was noted to be much more somnolent. Initially, she was
   quite sleepy and not responding to verbal stimuli and eventually awoke
   to sternal rub. ABGs were attempted bilaterally by the attending but
   were unable to be obtained.  Noted to be hypothermic to 95.6. BP
   107/48, HR 70, O2 sat 100% RA. CXR done showing no major change.
   .
   Upon arrival to the ICU, the patient is awake, conversant, and oriented
   to self only.  Good cough, protecting airway.

   Assessment and Plan
 HYPERNATREMIA (HIGH SODIUM)
 HEPARIN-INDUCED THROMBOCYTOPENIA
 SEPSIS WITHOUT ORGAN DYSFUNCTION
 AIRWAY, INABILITY TO PROTECT (RISK FOR ASPIRATION, ALTERED GAG,
   AIRWAY CLEARANCE, COUGH)
 HYPOTENSION (NOT SHOCK)
 BRADYCARDIA
 ALTERED MENTAL STATUS (NOT DELIRIUM)
   80 year old female with hx of DM2, HTN, dementia and frequent UTIs
   presents with altered mental status, hypotension, and bradycardia and
   found to have urosepsis and thrombocytopenia. Now with decreased
   responsiveness.
   .
   # Decreased responsiveness: Unclear source. HD stable and satting well,
   no signs of aspiration on CXR. No signs of hypercarbia on ABG. [**Month (only) 11**] have
   just been a little sleepy as she corrected quickly.
   -Urine/blood cx
   -CT head given recent begining of AC but no focal neuro deficits seen.
   -CXR in am to double check for aspiration
   .
   #. ID: Patient with resolving urosepsis, now hemodynamically stable.
   Patient with enterococcus and PROVIDENCIA STUARTII urine. Patient on
   Ampicillin (d [**2-28**]) and CTX (D [**8-8**]). Patient afebrile (Temp 94-95 in
   ICU), but leukocytosis worse today. CXR with ill defined opacity in
   RLL. CXR could be demonstrating an early infiltrate and patient could
   be at risk for VAP. Patient s/p extubation [**1-17**]. Patient had been
   receiving stress dose steroids in the ICU.
   - Vanc/Cefepime will cover both Entercoccus and Providencia.
   - Trend Leukocytosis, Fever curve
   .
   # Anemia, thrombocytopenia: Unclear if patient [**Month (only) 11**] be bone marrow
   suppression due to infection. No signs of hemolysis on current labs.
   DIC labs negative. HIT ab positive, but heme feels low suspicion of
   actualy HIT. She is intermediate probability and has no obvious
   sequelae from HIT. Serotonin release assay pending. Argatroban stopped
   yseterday and platelets continue to improve.
   - f/u Hematology recs
   - follow seratonic release assay
   - Hold heparin products for now
   .
   # RUE Swelling: Asymmetrical, R>L. Ultrasound obtained shows a
   non-occlusive thrombus of RIJ, likely etiology of RUE swelling.
   -Con't Fondaparinox and Coumadin until therapeutic pending head CT
   .
   # Acute renal failure: Resolved. Cr 0.9. Likely had ATN from
   hypotension. Patient with R sided volume overload.
   - Renally dose meds
   .
   # Rhythm: Patient had presented with sinus bradycardia w/ 1st degree AV
   Delay, likely in the setting of sepsis. Patient's HR has been in 80s
   since transfer.
   - Monitor on telemetry
   - Hold BB for now
