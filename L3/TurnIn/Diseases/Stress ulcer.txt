A stress ulcer is a single or multiple mucosal defect which can become complicated by upper gastrointestinal bleeding or physiologic stress. Ordinary peptic ulcers are found commonly in the gastric antrum and the duodenum whereas stress ulcers are found commonly in fundic mucosa and can be located anywhere within the stomach and proximal duodenum.
