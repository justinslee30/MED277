   63 yo M with h/o DM type 1, PVD, and HTN who presents with
   hyperglycemia and altered mental status. The patient states that he was
   in his USOH until Monday, when he awoke with abdominal pain and nausea.
   He could not eat anything so he didn't take his insulin. He did not
   vomit or experience fevers/chills, nor any dysuria, new cough, or URI
   sxs. He did manage to go to his numerous medical appointments that day,
   when he was seen by PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) 276**], and dentist.
   .
   Per wife, the dentist foud a large mouth abscess for which he was
   prescribed clindamycin 150mg qid x 7 days. Otherwise visits were
   without incident. Sugars have been running very erratically, with FSG
   on [**1-19**]- [**1-20**] ranging from 70's to 500+. Today, after returning from
   work, she found him slumped over at his computer and confused. Checked
   BS and was so high meter didn't read number. Called Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 488**],
   rechecked BS, was still higher than readable, so called EMS. Was
   disoriented, calling son by name and stating he needed 750 units of
   insulin.
   .
   In the ED, vitals were stable. Initial labs were notable for glucose
   769, HCO3 9, AG 32, WBC 21.3, lactate 3.9, UA positive for ketones. CXR
   without acute process, EKG with new [**Street Address(2) 489**] dep V5-6, 0.[**Street Address(2) 490**] dep II,
   III, aVF. ABG 7.08/25/104/8. He was started on an insulin gtt at 8
   units/hr, given 4 L IVFs, asa 325 po X 1, levaquin 500 mg IV X 1, and
   flagyl 500 mg IV X 1.

   acute process. Pt did c/o nausea and vomiting for 2 days but it is
   unclear whether this was acute precipitant of DKA or rather symptom.
   Appears that insulin regimen was very erratic, which is probably the
   precipitant.
   -- Continue insulin gtt@ 0.1units/kg, titrating for goal FS < 150.
   -- q1h FS.
   -- Aggressive IVF hydration with 1/2 NS @ 300cc/hr x 3L.
   -- once AG closes, will switch over to sQ insulin 1 hr prior to
   shutting off insulin gtt.
   -- if glucose <250 and still has AG, change to D5 1/2 NS.
   -- check lytes q4h.
   -- Aggressive lytes repletion, add KCL to IVF once K < 4.0.
   -- [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult in am.
   .
   #) Leukocytosis - WBC 21.3 with left shift, UA negative, CXR without
   acute processes. Per wife, seen at [**Hospital1 491**] dental earlier this
   week for ? tooth abscess; however no abscess noted on exam, pt
   afebrile. Leukocytosis is also a classic feature of DKA so this is the
   most likely etiology.
   -- trend WBC count
   -- continue clindamycin 150mg qid as prescribed by dentistry
   -- Contact Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 492**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 493**] in am at [**Telephone/Fax (1) 494**] to obtain further
   information in regards to possible tooth abscess.

   #) ST depressions - In pt without known h/o CAD but with CAD equivalent
   in DM. Cardiac enzymes negative. Was most liekly a hypovolemic demand
   strain.
   -- Recheck EKG in am.
   -- Telemetry overnight.
   -- Cycle cardiac enzymes.
   .
   #) Hyponatremia - Psuedohyponatremia [**1-24**] elevated glucose.
   -- normalizing with glucose correction
   .
   #) Acute renal failure - In setting of DKA, intravascularly dry, BUN/Cr
   ratio > 20.
   -- Aggressive IVF hydration overnight as above, closely follow BUN/Cr.
   .
   #) Nausea/vomiting - Likely [**1-24**] DKA vs. viral gastroenteritis.
   -- Check LFTs, amylase (may be elevated simply due to DKA), lipase.
   -- Anti-emetics prn.
   .
   #) DM type 1
   -- DKA management as above
   -- lyrica for neuropathic pain
   -- [**Last Name (un) 276**] consult in am.
   .
   #) Foot ulcers/PVD - Followed by podiatry and [**Hospital **] clinic.
   -- call podiatry in AM for wound and dressing recs
   .
   #) HTN - Continue diovan, amlodipine, lisinopril.
   .
   #) Hypercholesterolemia - Continue statin.
   .
   #) Depression - Continue wellbutrin, effexor.
   .
   #) Smoking cessation - Possible that nausea and vomiting may be related
   to chantix; however, wife [**Name (NI) 495**] he has not been taking this med so
   this is less likely
   .
   #) FEN/GI - NPO for now, replete lytes as above

   Assessment and Plan
   24 yo F with history of idiopathic chronic urticaria and angioedema,
   asthma, and seasonal allergies who presents with tongue swelling.
   .
   #) Angioedema - Followed by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 484**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 483**] as outpt for idiopathic
   chronic urticaria and angioedema with multiple admissions in past year
   for angioedema. Given solumedrol 125 mg IV, benadryl 50 mg, and
   famotidine 20 mg in ED. Currently no signs of airway compromise on
   exam.
   - Continue outpt regimen of benadryl, fexofenadine (in house substitute
   for loratidine), and ranitidine.
   - Start prednisone 60 mg daily.
   - Overnight observation in ICU for signs of airway compromise.
   - If signs of airway compromise overnight, administer epipen and
   intubate.
   - Will contact Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 483**] in am.
   .
   #) Anemia
 Baseline Hct in upper 20
s to low 30
s, iron studies [**9-4**]
   with significant iron deficiency (ferritin 5, iron 15, TIBC 464). Hct
   on admission 36.6. MCV low.  RDW also elevated which may be suggestive
   of thalassemia.
   - Recheck iron studies in am. Guaiac stools, follow Hcts.
   .
   #) Asthma - Continue flovent.
   .
   #) Seasonal allergies - Continue fexofenadine (in house substitute for
   loratidine).

"****NEW-NOTE****Chief Complaint:  Shortness of breath, fever
   HPI:
   Ms. [**Known lastname 686**] is an 83-year-old Russian-speaking woman with PMH of
   COPD, HTN, CVA, and T2DM who presents to the ED from [**Hospital 12**] Rehab with
   fever and shortness of breath. She was noted to have N/V and lower
   abdominal pain for one day prior to admission, when she was found to be
   drowsy and weak. She had a CXR at HR which was read as no acute changes
   from prior. During transport she received SL nitro x 1 and Lasix 20 mg
   IV x 1.
   In the ED initial vitals were T101.6, BP 175/104, HR 116, 93% on NRB
   eventually improving to 98%. She did not tolerate BiPAP. She vomited a
   small amount of coffee ground emesis in the ED. Nitro gtt was started
   for BP of 194/131. A CTA was done which was negative for PE. An EKG
   showed sinus tach with LAD and no acute ST changes or Q waves. She was
   given tylenol, combivent nebs x 3, levaquin 750mg IV x 1, cefepime 1g
   IV x 1, flagyl 500mg IV x1, and protonix 40mg IV x1. GI was made aware
   and pt was admitted ot [**Hospital Unit Name 44**] for further care.
   Upon arrival to the [**Hospital Unit Name 44**], further history was obtained with translator.
   She explained that she has had SOB x 1 week along with dysuria and
   lower abdominal pain of unclear length. She denied CP. She admits to a
   dry cough x 1 week as well. Also explains that she has had N/V. She
   also admits to constipation. She currently lives at [**Hospital 12**] Rehab and
   has done so for the past year. Ambulates at baseline without
   assistance. Niece and nephew are her family contact.
